        Preparation time: 1:30 hours
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Preparation:
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Step 1: In a bowl mix the high liter of cream terrine with cheese and condensed 
        milk . The amount of cheese and the milk will get to our taste ( if you want 
        more sweetness add more condensed milk and add more cheese if you want more than 
        this ) . Grind all with mixer until well blended
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Step 2: Furthermore prepare gelatin as put in the instructions ( the gelatin has 
        to be neutral . I use royal brand ) . When we booked and let cool .
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Step 3: Now prepare the coulis . This is made by putting a whole jar of 
        marmalade to fire in a saucepan with half a glass of water. When starting to 
        boil, retired and snuck to remove the pips ( the coulis is seedless jam ) .
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Step 4: Now prepare the base. Crush the cookies into a powder and mix with the 
        melted butter in the microwave. We will obtain a paste which cover the base of 
        the mold where we are going to make the cake . I like a touch of oven ( broil ) 
        for cookie crisp. A mixture of the cheese milk with added gelatin tibia . Mix 
        well and pour ( we pour the mixture slowly , over a spoon so you do not break 
        the base) before the mixture prepared .
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Step 5: Let cool in the fridge for about 4 hours and desamoldamos . Just then we 
        add the coulis before we made</p>
    <p>
        
        Difficulty: Hard</p>
