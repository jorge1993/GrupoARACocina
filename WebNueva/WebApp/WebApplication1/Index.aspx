           <p style="margin-left: 80px">

               <em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em><br /> <br />

        2 sandwiches&nbsp; <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
    
        2 tablespoon olive oil <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        2 garlic cloves, sliced <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        1 bunch kale, rinsed and cut in 1-inch ribbons <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        pinch chile flakes <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        1 tablespoon capers, drained <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        salt <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        lemon <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        1/3 cup ricotta <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        4 strips bacon, cooked until very crisp <br style="margin-left: 40px" />
        4 slices bread, toasted (with butter in a hot skillet is how I like to to it)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br />

               <em><strong>Steps</strong></em><br /> <br />

        Add the oil to a hot skillet. When the oil is shimmering add the garlic and 
        saute until fragrant, about 30 second over medium-high heat. Add all of the kale 
        along with a pinch of salt and chile flakes (or sliced fresh chile if you have 
        it). Saute until wilted and soft, about 3 minutes. <br /> <br />

        Transfer the kale to a bowl then stir in the capers. Taste and add more salt if 
        needed and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice if you happen to have it on hand.
        At this point I toast the bread in the still-hot skillet with a bit of butter. 
        Try rubbing the bread with a garlic clove for another boost of flavor. <br /> <br />

        Divide the ricotta between the four slices of bread. Add the kale to two halves, 
        then two strips of bacon on each sandwich and finally, top the with the other 
        pieces of bread with ricotta. <br /> <br />

        Slice in half then enjoy.
